Engineering Branch Analytics

1. Introduction:

This Python project uses the Pandas, Matplotlib, and NumPy libraries to analyze engineering branches based on job stability, innovation, job growth, and student enrollment. The analysis is divided into three sections, each focusing on a specific aspect.

2. Libraries Used:

Pandas: For data manipulation and reading CSV files.

Matplotlib: For data visualization (bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts).

NumPy: For numerical operations.

3. Code Breakdown:

SECTION 1: Best Branch for Stability and Innovation

The code reads data from Engineering_Branch_Analytics.csv.

It calculates a score by adding the number of startups and the count of emerging technologies for each branch.

The branch with the highest score is identified as the best option for students.

A bar chart is plotted with two bars for each branch: one representing the number of startups and the other representing the count of emerging technologies.

Visualization:

Red bars represent startups.

Yellow bars represent emerging technologies.

Labels show values with '%' for startups and 'tech' for technologies.

SECTION 2: Growth Rate of Engineering Branches (2010-2024)

The code reads data from job_growth_by_branch.csv.

The data is indexed by year and transposed to plot job growth for each branch.

A line graph is plotted with markers to visualize trends.

The X-axis represents the year, and the Y-axis represents the number of people in crores.

SECTION 3: Student Enrollment Distribution

The number of students enrolled in each branch is visualized using a pie chart.

Each section of the pie chart represents a different branch.

Labels indicate branch names and percentages.

4. Output:

A message is printed displaying the branch that offers the best combination of stability and innovation.

Three visualizations are displayed: a bar chart, a line graph, and a pie chart.

5. Conclusion:

This project efficiently visualizes key insights about engineering branches, helping students and educators make informed decisions based on job stability, growth rates, and enrollment trends. The use of clear and distinct visualizations ensures that the data is both accessible and actionable.
